# EvtoCreations

This is a proprietary Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built using React for the frontend and Supabase for the database and backend services. It is designed to streamline internal operations, focusing on core resource management.

## Key functionalities include:

### Inventory Management: 
  Comprehensive material registration and stock level tracking for all inputs and supplies.

### Order Processing: 
  Management of purchase and work orders.

### Financial Tracking: 
  Recording of incomes and expenses.

### Performance Monitoring: 
  A dedicated dashboard displaying key metrics and analytics related to inventory, orders, and financials.

The system is strictly an internal tool with no e-commerce or online sales capabilities. A minimal security layer is implemented to ensure data confidentiality and prevent direct, unauthorized access to the Supabase hosted data.
